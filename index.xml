I am learning that when even a hand or arm is added to the frame, my imagination wanders, a story forms.&lt;/p><img src="/photos/2021-11-09-farmers-market/farmers-market-01-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-11-09-farmers-market/farmers-market-02-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-11-09-farmers-market/farmers-market-03-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-11-09-farmers-market/farmers-market-04-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-11-09-farmers-market/farmers-market-05-Pano.jpg" alt=""/></item><item><title>Photo Essay: Snowy Walk in the Neighborhood</title><link>https://andsplat.com/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andsplat.com/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/</guid><description>&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">We woke up to snow on Sunday morning. After attending virtual church because of COVID-19, we put on our ski gear and went for a walk in the neighborhood. It was satisfying to make the first steps in the fresh blanket of snow as we went for our walk. It was good to run into neighbors during our walk, to hear and see the neighborhood children enjoying the hilly terrain, and to have moments of silence in the cool, crisp air.&lt;/p><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-01-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-02.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-03.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-04-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-05-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-06.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-07.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-08-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-09-Pano.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-10.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-11.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-12.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-13.jpg" alt=""><img src="/photos/2021-02-03-snowy-walk/snowday-14-Pano.jpg" alt=""/></item><item><title>The Lost Show: A Virtual Photography Show</title><link>https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Note: Originally this was a series of blog posts that I posted 1-10 April 2020. I have edited the original series into the following single post.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-virtual-photography-show">A virtual photography show&lt;/h2>
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">A small collection of my photographs are currently on exhibit at my church. The problem is, as you might guess with COVID-19, no one is there to see my photographs.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-01.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-01.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>My photographs on display at church&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We have a visual arts ministry that includes the opportunity to share artwork in our fellowship hall and I was excited when asked to share my photography from 27 February to 7 May 2020. Since we are now meeting for church virtually, I have been thinking of ways to share my photographs. I am going to start with a blog series where I will share my photographs and provide a little information about the process and equipment used to create the images. I am also considering creating and selling a photo zine and prints (let me know if you’re interested). &lt;em>[Note: I did create the photo zine! &lt;a href="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/#zine">See the end of this post for details&lt;/a>.]&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start, I am going to share the artist statement that I wrote for the show:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="artist-statement">Artist Statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I fondly remember taking photos of the Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular at Disney as a kid in mid-90s. The photos that I enjoyed taking the most were not the fire or action, but between the action when they took the set apart and I could see where the actor playing Indiana Jones hid when the giant ball rolled down the hill. Twenty-five years later I still love capturing the overlooked details around me in my photography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mainly shoot film (35mm and medium format) and have been developing my own black and white film at home for just over two years. In January 2020, I built my first darkroom in a spare bathroom (thanks, Austin!). All of the black and white photos on display were printed in my darkroom. The color photographs are either digital or a hybrid (color film that I shot and then scanned).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find shooting film helps me to slow down and see the beauty around me. I studied architecture at UVA and am drawn to the built environment and how we use the space and objects around us. I hope my photography helps you to also slow down and look at something you might have passed by without a second thought during the rush of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ben W. Fey&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I hope you and your family are staying healthy and safe!&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="the-tate">The Tate&lt;/h2>

&lt;figcaption>The Tate, 2019. Nikon F2AS, Kodak T-MAX 400 35mm&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">As discussed in my Artist Statement above, all of the black and white photographs in this show were printed in my new home darkroom. Since this is a virtual photography show, I am not able to show you the darkroom printed versions of the photographs, but am instead showing you the digital scans I made. In order to match the darkroom printed photograph that you would see in person, I have re-edited each scan to approximate the feeling of the darkroom print (crop and contrast).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first photograph that I wanted to share is a photo that I took at the Tate Modern art museum in London. Austin and I traveled to England last summer and 6 of the 17 photos in this show are from that trip.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those interested in gear, I traveled with my Fujifilm X-T2 digital mirrorless camera and Nikon F2AS 35mm film camera. I find the process of shooting film more satisfying—it helps me to slow down and see the light and details around me. If I was packing for the trip again, I would bring one or two film cameras instead of one digital and one film camera.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we first visited the Tate Modern, I had to stop and take a few photographs before we started to see the art. The enormous scale of the space, the bright light streaming in, and the child running in one of the beams of light—how could I not stop and take a few photographs?&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="oxford">Oxford&lt;/h2>
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">The next two photographs are also from our trip to England. This time we visit Magdalen College, Oxford.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-03.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-03.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Medieval Hall, Magdalen College, Oxford, 2019. Nikon F2AS, Kodak Tri-X 400 35mm&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>While traveling in England last summer, Austin and I spent a few days in Oxford. Our small bed and breakfast was not too far from Magdalen College so we walked there after dropping off our luggage. Fun fact: C.S. Lewis was a Fellow and English Tutor at Magdalen College from 1925-1954. Austin and I wanted to attend the Evensong service at the Magdalen College Chapel and while we waited for that to start, we walked around the college and took photographs. The photograph above is of the Medieval Hall, a place where students gather together for meals.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-04.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-04.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Evensong, Magdalen College, Oxford, 2019. Nikon F2AS, Kodak Tri-X 400 35mm&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When we first entered Magdalen College, I stopped and started to take photographs of the first courtyard area. Little did I know, I was standing in the direct path of the choir that would sing in the Evensong service later that evening. I was looking through the viewfinder when I was startled by the group politely asking for me to get out of the way. Apparently the choir does not deviate from their path. I apologized and quickly got out of the way and took this photograph.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="university-of-virginia">University of Virginia&lt;/h2>
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">For this section, we travel closer to home: the University of Virginia. For living in Charlottesville, I don’t visit the university as much as I should, especially as there are plenty of interesting things to photograph.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-05.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-05.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>The Rotunda, 2018. Hasselblad 500cm, Kodak T-MAX 400 120 film&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Another thing I don’t do enough these days is shoot with my Hasselblad 500cm. I enjoy how the Rotunda is framed by the trees in the photograph above and while a lot of the image is dark, you can still see some details of the paths crossing at the bottom of the photograph.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-06.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-06.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Outdoor Piano, 2018. Hasselblad 500cm, Ilford HP5 120 film&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I don’t know why, but there is an old piano outside near the UVA School of Architecture (my alma mater). When I saw the piano, I knew I had to take a photograph. I love how the keys are stuck at different heights. If the outside of this piano looks this bad, I’m curious how bad it looks on the inside. As a musician, I’m torn on this as art—I really hope the piano was already broken before it was left to the elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="sky-and-ground">Sky and ground&lt;/h2>
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">In this section, I wanted to explore the natural and manufactured—sky and ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-07.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-07.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Left: The Grand Canyon, 2017, Nikon F3, Kodak Ektar 100 35mm&lt;br>Right: Utility Pole, 2016, Nikon D750 Digital&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The photographs above are two very different locations—the Grand Canyon versus a utility pole in town—but they both cause me to look up to the sky and then back down to how the object connects to the ground. The photography on the left is from our family Grand Canyon vacation in 2017. For that trip I packed both my Nikon F3 film SLR and Nikon D750 DSLR. I didn’t realize my Nikon F3 had an issue where the shutter would randomly fire at the maximum 1/2000th shutter speed, massively underexposing random frames. I’m thankful that I was still able to get most of the photographs that I took with the camera during that trip and have since replaced my Nikon F3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similar to the pair of photographs above, the photographs below are very different locations—the Antelope Slot Canyon versus a car wash in town—but they both cause me to be be aware of the ground and notice the different curves that play with the available light. Awareness of the ground through my memory of climbing into the earth to see the Antelope Slot Canyon and my eye being pulled to the leaf on the ground at the car wash.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-08.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-08.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="lake-district">Lake District&lt;/h2>
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">In the middle of our England vacation last summer we spent a few days in the Lake District. If you have not visited the Lake District, you should do that the next time you are in England. Both photographs below are from a short walk we did to Brant Fell, a hill that overlooks Bowness-on-Windermere. The views were incredible.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-09.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-09.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Lake District, UK, 2019. Nikon F2AS, Kodak Tri-X 400 35mm&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I loved the texture of this mossy wall during our walk. The sun was shining through the trees above, leaving an interesting dotted light on the wall.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-10.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-10.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Mossy Stone Wall, Lake District, UK, 2019. Nikon F2AS, Kodak Tri-X 400 35mm&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="the-lawn">The Lawn&lt;/h2>
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">Last year I participated in Expired Film Day, a competition where people are asked to have fun shooting expired film. I don’t often shoot expired film as film is expensive and expired film can act in unpredictable ways as it ages. Overtime film becomes less stable and less sensitive to light. This can cause color shifts, grain issues, and more. I also used Expired Film Day as an excuse to adapt 35mm film to fit in my Hasselblad 500cm for the first time—resulting in photographs that cover the sprocket holes and is more panoramic. For this experiment, Austin and I went to the University of Virginia to take some photographs of the Lawn and Gardens.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-11.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-11.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>UVA Garden, 2019, Hasselblad 500cm&lt;br>Expired Kodak Gold 400 35mm film adapted for 120&lt;/figcaption>

&lt;figcaption>UVA Rotunda, 2019, Hasselblad 500cm&lt;br>Expired Kodak Gold 400 35mm film adapted for 120&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In order to get 35mm film to flow through my Hasselblad 500cm in a predictable and mostly centered way I made a 35mm to 120 film adapter set. You can buy 3D printed versions of these online, but I figured I could try and make my own with existing 120 film spools that I had at home. I used a Dremel tool to file existing 120 film spools down to size and then glued them together so they equaled the height of a regular 120 film spool with the 35mm film moving more or less in the middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-13.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-13.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Left and center: homemade 35mm to 120 film adapter&lt;br>Right: regular 120 film spool&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="around-the-corner">Around the corner&lt;/h2>
&lt;p class="has-drop-cap">The photographs in my virtual photography show have been from a few different places: London, Oxford, the Lake District, the Grand Canyon, the Antelope Slot Canyon, and our home of Charlottesville. In the days of social distancing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I miss the ability to travel with a camera. Most of the photographs in this final post are from Charlottesville (with one photograph from London).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-14.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-14.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Out of Order, 2018, Seagull TLR, Ilford Delta 100 Pro 120 film&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>From time to time I will go out on a photowalk and take photographs of things that jump out to me. When I was walking near Downtown Charlottesville, I noticed this out of order crosswalk button. I enjoyed two different things in this scene: the texture of the peeled-away sticker and the fact that the “out of order” sign is fairly permanent.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-15.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-15.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Winter Pines, 2019, Hasselblad 500cm, Kodak T-MAX 400 120 film&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The photograph of the snow covered pine trees was taken from our back deck. I was about to eat breakfast one morning and noticed how the snow weighed down the branches of our neighbor’s pine trees and had to stop and take a few photographs.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-16.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-16.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>London Tube Utilities, 2019, Nikon F2AS, Kodak T-MAX 400 35mm&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I took the London Tube Utilities photograph while Austin and I were waiting for the Tube to arrive during our vacation last summer. While on the platform I noticed the dense web of utilities across the way. I appreciate how organized and tidy they are—I wonder: when were they added? were they added at the same time? over several decades?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="thelostshow-17.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2020-04-10-the-lost-show/thelostshow-17.jpg" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Peppers, 2019, Minolta 7s, Kodak Tri-X 400 35mm&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We don’t go to the downtown market often, but when we do, I tend to bring a camera. I’m drawn to the gradient and texture of the peppers and how they are randomly spread out over the table. There is a weight to the peppers. I feel like they could fall from the top of the frame to the bottom at any moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do enjoy traveling with a camera—capturing new locations and details. As I have been organizing and writing these posts, I have been encouraged that a good number of the photographs are of locations and details close to home. If asked about my photography show, I would have guessed most of the photographs were from our trip to England. Looking back, a majority of the photographs are from locations near home—and even our backyard. During this time of staying home, taking photographs of the same locations over and over as we take our afternoon walks, I am trying to slow down and look at something I passed by the previous day or week without a second thought—the beauty just around the corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope you and your family are safe and healthy. Thank you for taking the time to join me for my virtual photography show.&lt;/p>

I really want to learn the limits of what I can do with this camera and the only way to do that is use the camera more. In the past, I mainly have shot landscapes and architecture and have always struggled with taking photos of people. I recently realized that capturing photos of friends and family are going to be the photos that I cherish the most. Practice makes perfect, so I have been trying to take my Hasselblad with me more to learn what I can do with this camera and to get better at portraits and everyday life photography (what is the slowest I can take handheld shots, how to focus faster to capture fleeting moments, etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is a learning process, I wanted to share an entire roll of film, not just the “good” photos. For this roll of film, I was shooting at three different locations on three different days. I ended up shooting 4 frames at each location (not planned) and generally wish I had more light in all of these. I was shooting Kodak Tri-X 400 pushed to 1600 and developed the film at home in Rodinal 1:50. I think I would have liked to have 1 more stop of light in almost all of the photos in order to get denser negatives. I like the harsh contrast in some of these, but would have preferred to have that as a creative part of processing and less a result of no data on the negative. I scanned all of these images at home with my Nikon D750, an old enlarger-turned-copystand, Kaiser backlight, and the Nikon 55mm 3.5 Micro.&lt;/p>

It was a great vacation and if you haven't visited the Grand Canyon, you should make that happen. I don't know what I was expecting, but the views of the canyon were indeed grand. It seems to be appropriately named.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Why am I talking about the Grand Canyon in a post about film photography? I think it was the Grand Canyon trip that reminded me how much I love film photography. This was something I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know, but looking back, I see it now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have always been interested in photography. I can even remember a photography competition that I entered in elementary school where they gave us Kodak disposable cameras. I took a photo of a nearby waterfall. I&amp;rsquo;m sure the photo wasn&amp;rsquo;t great, but I have good memories of the competition. I also have good memories of my parent&amp;rsquo;s film cameras: a Kodak 110mm camera and Canon point and shoot 35mm camera.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>Grand Canyon, Nikon F3, 50mm f/1.8 AFD, Kodak Ektar 100, EPSON V550 Scanner&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Through college I mainly shot digital (Nikon Coolpix, Canon G7, and then a Nikon D80). I don&amp;rsquo;t fully know why, but while in college, I purchased a 1958 Zorki 4 35mm film rangefinder camera with a Jupiter-8 50mm f/2.0 lens and a Holga toy medium format film camera. Two film cameras. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a light meter at the time, and just shot a few rolls of film using the Sunny 16 rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fast forward to after college when I was living in New York City. I was still using my Nikon D80 for most of my photography, but I bought the classic Nikon F3 from Adorama, a Polaroid SX-70 from the Brooklyn Flea Market, and a Seagull TLR from B&amp;amp;H. All film cameras. It was during my time in New York that my parents bought me my first light meter for Christmas, a Sekonic L-208. Some of my favorite photos from my time living in NYC were from these film cameras.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="GrandCanyon_020.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2019-01-23-love-of-film-photography/GrandCanyon_020.jpg" class="imgcenter" alt="image">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Grand Canyon, Nikon F3, 50mm f/1.8 AFD, Kodak Ektar 100, EPSON V550 Scanner&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What is it about film? Is it the nostalgia? Probably a little, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, but I think the main reason I enjoy film photography is the pace. I find I slow down and think more about the framing, the light, the motion of the object before taking the photo. While living in New York, I gave myself rules that when I walked around the neighborhood I could only take 36 frames with my Nikon D80, as if I had a roll of film in the camera and not a SD card that could hold hundreds of photos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, back to the Grand Canyon. When we went to the Grand Canyon, I decided it would be a great opportunity to take both my Nikon D750 full frame DSLR and my Nikon F3 35mm film SLR. I walked around the canyon with both cameras, one hanging from each side and a tripod in my bag. Yes, it was heavy carrying both cameras, but I am so glad I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Before the Grand Canyon trip, I mainly shot with digital cameras. After experiencing the Grand Canyon with a digital camera and a film camera, I now mainly shoot film. Yes, some of my favorite photos from the Grand Canyon trip are from my Nikon D750, a digital camera, but shooting with the Nikon F3 during this trip helped me realize that I enjoy shooting with film more. I find I see things better when shoot with film, I actually look at what I am shooting. When I&amp;rsquo;m shooting the Nikon D750, I am looking at the back LCD screen and making adjustments. It&amp;rsquo;s more stressful as I feel I can make sure I capture the shot. If I miss the shot with a film camera (both from timing or exposure errors), it&amp;rsquo;s a learning experience. I also look around me more instead of at a LCD screen on the back of my camera, so I&amp;rsquo;m more present in my surroundings when shooting film.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Grand Canyon trip was in July 2017. Since then, I have bought 6 more cameras (5 film and 1 digital), sold 4 cameras, and bought a new light meter (Sekonic L-558). I have also started to develop my own black and white film at home and scan my film with my Nikon D750, two subjects I want to write about in the near future. I still shoot digital cameras, but am enjoying being able to focus time on my film photography. Perhaps film photography will help me finally write more on my blog!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="braun-apple-lamy-1.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-04-19-braun-apple-lamy/braun-apple-lamy-1.jpg" alt="Braun">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that my Lamy Safari and Apple AirPods are the same color helps the two products look good together, but there are a few other similarities that I noticed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Glossy finish&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dark rounded rectangles (ink window versus speaker design)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Metal accents&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="braun-apple-lamy-2.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-04-19-braun-apple-lamy/braun-apple-lamy-2.jpg" alt="Braun">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more I thought about the Apple AirPods and Lamy Safari fountain pen, it reminded me of Braun design (back when Braun design was interesting). This isn’t too shocking as a lot of Apple’s designs have to be inspired by Braun (if they aren’t, I’d be shocked).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I flipped through my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BRAUN-Fifty-Years-Design-Innovation-Polster/dp/393668135X" target="_blank">Braun: Fifty Years of Design and Innovation&lt;/a> book and found a photo of electric shavers from the 1960s. I know it isn’t an exact match, but I feel there are some similarities between the Apple AirPods case and the Braun electric shavers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I usually have a fountain pen nearby and over the years have started using pocket notebooks. I like the look of &lt;a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/" target="_blank">Field Notes Brand&lt;/a> notebooks and use Field Notes to take notes at church or write down ideas/to-do lists. I like the way Field Notes look, but it is common knowledge the paper that is typically used in these pocket notebooks is not great for fountain pens (which doesn’t stop me from using Field Notes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find &lt;a href="https://rhodiapads.com/" target="_blank">Rhodia&lt;/a> paper to be pretty great for fountain pens (no bleeding, no feathering). My only real complaint with Rhodia paper is that it sometimes takes too long to dry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like pocket notebooks (3.5” x 5.5”).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like Rhodia paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Rhodia doesn’t make a 3.5” x 5.5” notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The closest size notebook that Rhodia makes is a side-stapled A7 (3” x 4.75”) pocket notebook which is a bit small for me as I already find the Field Notes format to be small at times. Also, I don’t believe that notebook comes in dot grid (which is my favorite).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-solution">The solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Make my own notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve made a custom pocket notebook with Rhodia paper before, but this time I wanted to also incorporate my interest in photography.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-steps-that-i-took">The Steps that I took:&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="step-1-photography">Step 1: Photography&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When designing the cover, I used a photo that I took with my Nikon F3 and added my logo. I printed the cover on Red River 60lb Premium Matte Card Paper. One nice aspect of using this paper for my cover is it is already scored in the middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-1.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-1.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-2-rhodia-paper">Step 2: Rhodia Paper&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since I wanted to have a 3.5” x 5.5” notebook in the end, I used the N 19 Rhodia dotPad (8.3” x 12.5”) as I could fold that paper in half and trim the edges. I took 12 sheets of paper off the pad to be used in the notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-2.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-2.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-3-fold">Step 3: Fold&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Using a bone folder, I folded all 12 sheets in half.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-3.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-3.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-4.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-4.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-4-cover">Step 4: Cover&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I then placed the printed cover over the folded Rhodia paper sheets. It is finally starting to look like a notebook. You can also see in this image that I had marked where I wanted the final 3.5” x 5.5” notebook to be within the larger image. One nice aspect of starting with an oversized cover and insert paper is that you can have a full-bleed image on your cover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-5.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-5.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-5-trim-one-edge-dont-do-this">Step 5: Trim one edge (don’t do this)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is actually something I would do differently on the next notebook, but I’m showing you want I did for this notebook. Using the X-ACTO knife and metal ruler, I trimmed one edge. The problem that I ran into is that since the notebook isn’t stapled together yet, once I stapled the notebook, the paper had shifted, which meant I had to trim the edge again after stapling the notebook. Because of this, I would not trim any edges until I stapled the notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-6.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-6.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-6-staple">Step 6: Staple&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don’t have a book binding stapler so I had to improvise the stapling process. I saw this tip on a book binding video and have found it works pretty well. Don’t use the stapler in the normal configuration, but instead have the stapler fully open (as if you were going to staple into a cork board/bulletin board).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sorry I forgot to take a photo of this part at first, so please ignore the fact that I’m showing the stapler on a fully assembled notebook in the second photo of this step.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-7.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-7.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Place the eraser on the cutting mat and place the notebook fully open on top of the eraser so the eraser is under the spine of the notebook where you want a staple. Staple one staple (I started with the center staple).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-8.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-8.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After stapling one staple, flip the notebook over (the eraser should be stuck to the notebook as you just stapled it to the notebook).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-9.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-9.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remove the eraser from the staple. You should have the two sides of the staple pointing up at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-10.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-10.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use the metal ruler to bend the staple onto the paper. You have now completed one staple of the notebook. Repeat this step two more times for the remaining staples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-11.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-11.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-7-trim-remaining-edges">Step 7: Trim remaining edges&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I used the X-ACTO knife and metal ruler to trim the remaining edges of the notebook. As I mentioned above in Step 5, I recommend waiting until this step to trim all the edges just in case the paper shifts while stapling. Because the paper shifted, I had to re-trim the edge that I had originally cut in Step 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, you have a 3.5” x 5.5” (or close to that measurement after some trimming…) with square corners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-12.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-12.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-8-rounded-corners">Step 8: Rounded corners&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In this step, I used the Fiskars 3-in-1 Corner Squeeze Punch to round the two corners of the notebook to give it a more polished look. You can punch several sheets of paper at once, but make sure that the paper is aligned in the punch tool before punching the corners. You can re-punch corners if you didn’t fully have the paper in the tool, but you want to limit how much you keep punching corners as they could be uneven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-13.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-13.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-final-product">The final product&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now I have a custom pocket notebook filled with fountain pen friendly paper. It is also fun to have my photography and logo on the cover. The notebook isn’t perfect as it is handmade, but I enjoyed the process and it’s nice having a one-of-a-kind notebook to use. I need to think about what I would change when creating my next notebook.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you look under “Settings &amp;gt; General &amp;gt; Keyboard,” you will find a setting called “Text Replacement.” I believe the intended use is to create text shortcuts so you don’t have to type a phrase you use over and over. Apple includes a sample text replacement: when you type “omw,” it will be replaced with “On my way!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to create a different kind of “text replacement”:&lt;/p>

It’s been way too long since I last posted. I’ve wanted to post, but have just not made the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why blog? Will people even read my blog? Does it matter if people read my blog? I mainly blog as an excuse to design and build my own website. I also like sharing with friends the things I’m working on or random things I’ve observed (random typos in the world, for example).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past few years, I’ve started to really like fountain pans. I started with a cheap fountain pen from the local art store and then quickly moved on to the Lamy Safari, which then led to me buying a Pilot Vanishing Point. Fast forward to today and I now own around 19 fountain pens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I’ve started my fountain pen collection / hobby, I’ve wanted to write a review / blog post about pens. I’m not sure why it has taken me so long to write a post about pens. I think part of the problem is that there are already so many great pen bloggers already out there who have better collections and know much more about pens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK. Enough excuses / prologue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now to the main point of this post:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-architect-nib">The Architect Nib&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’ve mainly used Japanese fine fountain pen nibs and decided it was time to try a different kind of nib. I’ve heard a lot about the architect grind nib and thought it would be fun to try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found a great deal on Amazon for a Pilot Vanishing Point with a broad nib. I thought the Vanishing Point would work best since I could just replace the nib unit if I didn’t like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is an architect nib? Basically it is a nib that has thin vertical strokes and thick horizontal strokes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reading the review on &lt;a href="https://clickypost.com" target="_blank">clickypost.com&lt;/a> about the architect nib work by Daniel Smith, I decided to send my pen to &lt;a href="https://nibsmith.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Smith&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am really enjoying how the architect nib writes! It’s bolder than I’m used to, but I think the line variation adds a lot of character to my writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole process was pretty easy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Bought the pen and made sure it worked&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Emailed Daniel Smith about the architect nib work I wanted&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Shipped Daniel Smith my pen&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>He emailed scans of writing samples so I could see progress of the work&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>He made a few adjustments since I thought the first writing sample was too bold for me&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>He then suggested I try the pen&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Again, the pen, at first, seemed too bold for me, but the more I use the pen, the more fun it is to write with. Daniel Smith was very kind and patient with all my emails where I was going back and forth on how wide the nib should be. The quality of his work is also great. The nib is very smooth, which is a bit shocking for this kind of custom nib grind. I would definitely recommend Daniel Smith and would send more pens to him for custom grinds / tuning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of the architect nib was $55, plus shipping. I know that could seem like a lot for a pen, but I’ve enjoyed the pen so far. There are more expensive hobbies. That’s what I tell myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note: Below are some writing samples (including this blog post as it originally existed: a hand written blog post). Part of me doesn’t want to share the blog post that I wrote by hand since it’s not my neatest handwriting example, but I figured this would be a good way for people to see what the architect nib looks like in practice.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On January 26, 2013, I married my beautiful bride Austin. Needless to say, it was a great day. I’m so thankful to have Austin in my life. She is so loving, caring, and supportive. Having her in my life is truly a blessing. It’s been a wonderful adventure as we figure out married life together and I look forward to many more adventures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="chucks.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2014-01-26-first-anniversary/chucks.jpg" alt="chucks">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing that I’m thankful for is my health. People say you will never forget your wedding day, but I can truly say that Austin and I will never forget our wedding week. The Monday before our wedding, I received some scary health news. Two days later, I was in surgery. Yeah, busy week. I can’t fully describe how much love and support Austin and I felt that week from God, family, our church, and friends. Thankfully, the surgery went really well (we were blessed with awesome doctors and a great hospital) and we were able to still have the wedding ceremony as scheduled on Saturday (yes, three days after my surgery). Throughout the year, we’ve heard nothing but great news from the doctors at my followup appointments. The surgery and followup appointments have gone so well, that I sometimes forget that I even had a health scare. When I stop and think about it though, I’m so thankful for the many ways God has watched over us: providing a great hospital and doctors, a clean bill of health, amazing support from friends, family, church, work, and so much more.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I can’t believe it’s already been one year of marriage. Time flies! Some of the things we’ve enjoyed over the past year:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We setup our new apartment together (exciting! and only after several trips to Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond / Target)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Enjoyed practicing calligraphy (yes, we love pens, if you didn’t know)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>I learned how to ski (Austin and her family are very patient ski instructors!)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We celebrated: two sibling college graduations, several friends getting married (4 couples I believe!)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Served together at church (in the nursery and singing/playing bass on the worship team)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Added several board games to our collection&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Had quality time (sometimes over said board games) with friends and family&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is so much one could say when looking back on the past year of marriage. Through the ordinary, the extraordinary, the tough times, the good times, it’s such a blessing that we are growing and learning about life together as Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Fey (I love the sound of that). I love you, Austin!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Austin and I put together a wedding photo album as Christmas presents for our parents and grandparents. You can check out the &lt;a href="Ben-and-Austin-Fey_wedding_Jan-26-2013.pdf">PDF copy of the photo album (15 MB)&lt;/a> if you would like to see more photographs from our wedding.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;amp; (/and/): an ongoing conversation&lt;/p>
&lt;p>* (/splat/): about anything&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-logo">The logo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The logo (&amp;amp;*) was a happy keyboard mistake. I was trying to type an ampersand (&amp;amp;) between two words and accidentally also hit the asterisk (*) key. I really like the look of the ampersand and liked the asterisk beside it. I began to think about &amp;amp;* and found that it worked well as a concept for this website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-ampersand">The ampersand&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The ampersand is a way to show that this website is only part of the conversation. There are ideas, concepts, questions that happen before and after the posts on this blog. This is the middle of the conversation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-asterisk">The asterisk&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The asterisk can be considered a wildcard character or variable. I am inspired by many things and the asterisk (being a variable) allows me to talk about several different topics on the same website.&lt;/p><img src="/about/benwfey.jpg" alt=""/></item></channel></rss>
