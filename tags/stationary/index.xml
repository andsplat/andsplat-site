&lt;p>I usually have a fountain pen nearby and over the years have started using pocket notebooks. I like the look of &lt;a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/" target="_blank">Field Notes Brand&lt;/a> notebooks and use Field Notes to take notes at church or write down ideas/to-do lists. I like the way Field Notes look, but it is common knowledge the paper that is typically used in these pocket notebooks is not great for fountain pens (which doesn’t stop me from using Field Notes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find &lt;a href="https://rhodiapads.com/" target="_blank">Rhodia&lt;/a> paper to be pretty great for fountain pens (no bleeding, no feathering). My only real complaint with Rhodia paper is that it sometimes takes too long to dry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like pocket notebooks (3.5” x 5.5”).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like Rhodia paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Rhodia doesn’t make a 3.5” x 5.5” notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The closest size notebook that Rhodia makes is a side-stapled A7 (3” x 4.75”) pocket notebook which is a bit small for me as I already find the Field Notes format to be small at times. Also, I don’t believe that notebook comes in dot grid (which is my favorite).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-solution">The solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Make my own notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve made a custom pocket notebook with Rhodia paper before, but this time I wanted to also incorporate my interest in photography.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-steps-that-i-took">The Steps that I took:&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="step-1-photography">Step 1: Photography&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When designing the cover, I used a photo that I took with my Nikon F3 and added my logo. I printed the cover on Red River 60lb Premium Matte Card Paper. One nice aspect of using this paper for my cover is it is already scored in the middle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-1.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-1.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-2-rhodia-paper">Step 2: Rhodia Paper&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since I wanted to have a 3.5” x 5.5” notebook in the end, I used the N 19 Rhodia dotPad (8.3” x 12.5”) as I could fold that paper in half and trim the edges. I took 12 sheets of paper off the pad to be used in the notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-2.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-2.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-3-fold">Step 3: Fold&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Using a bone folder, I folded all 12 sheets in half.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-3.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-3.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-4.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-4.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-4-cover">Step 4: Cover&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I then placed the printed cover over the folded Rhodia paper sheets. It is finally starting to look like a notebook. You can also see in this image that I had marked where I wanted the final 3.5” x 5.5” notebook to be within the larger image. One nice aspect of starting with an oversized cover and insert paper is that you can have a full-bleed image on your cover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-5.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-5.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-5-trim-one-edge-dont-do-this">Step 5: Trim one edge (don’t do this)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is actually something I would do differently on the next notebook, but I’m showing you want I did for this notebook. Using the X-ACTO knife and metal ruler, I trimmed one edge. The problem that I ran into is that since the notebook isn’t stapled together yet, once I stapled the notebook, the paper had shifted, which meant I had to trim the edge again after stapling the notebook. Because of this, I would not trim any edges until I stapled the notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-6.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-6.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-6-staple">Step 6: Staple&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don’t have a book binding stapler so I had to improvise the stapling process. I saw this tip on a book binding video and have found it works pretty well. Don’t use the stapler in the normal configuration, but instead have the stapler fully open (as if you were going to staple into a cork board/bulletin board).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sorry I forgot to take a photo of this part at first, so please ignore the fact that I’m showing the stapler on a fully assembled notebook in the second photo of this step.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-7.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-7.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Place the eraser on the cutting mat and place the notebook fully open on top of the eraser so the eraser is under the spine of the notebook where you want a staple. Staple one staple (I started with the center staple).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-8.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-8.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After stapling one staple, flip the notebook over (the eraser should be stuck to the notebook as you just stapled it to the notebook).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-9.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-9.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remove the eraser from the staple. You should have the two sides of the staple pointing up at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-10.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-10.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use the metal ruler to bend the staple onto the paper. You have now completed one staple of the notebook. Repeat this step two more times for the remaining staples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-11.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-11.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-7-trim-remaining-edges">Step 7: Trim remaining edges&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I used the X-ACTO knife and metal ruler to trim the remaining edges of the notebook. As I mentioned above in Step 5, I recommend waiting until this step to trim all the edges just in case the paper shifts while stapling. Because the paper shifted, I had to re-trim the edge that I had originally cut in Step 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, you have a 3.5” x 5.5” (or close to that measurement after some trimming…) with square corners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-12.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-12.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-8-rounded-corners">Step 8: Rounded corners&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In this step, I used the Fiskars 3-in-1 Corner Squeeze Punch to round the two corners of the notebook to give it a more polished look. You can punch several sheets of paper at once, but make sure that the paper is aligned in the punch tool before punching the corners. You can re-punch corners if you didn’t fully have the paper in the tool, but you want to limit how much you keep punching corners as they could be uneven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="custom-notebook-13.jpg" data-lightbox="post">&lt;img src="https://andsplat.com/posts/2017-03-24-custom-notebook/custom-notebook-13.jpg" alt="custom notebook">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-final-product">The final product&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now I have a custom pocket notebook filled with fountain pen friendly paper. It is also fun to have my photography and logo on the cover. The notebook isn’t perfect as it is handmade, but I enjoyed the process and it’s nice having a one-of-a-kind notebook to use. I need to think about what I would change when creating my next notebook.&lt;/p>

It’s been way too long since I last posted. I’ve wanted to post, but have just not made the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why blog? Will people even read my blog? Does it matter if people read my blog? I mainly blog as an excuse to design and build my own website. I also like sharing with friends the things I’m working on or random things I’ve observed (random typos in the world, for example).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past few years, I’ve started to really like fountain pans. I started with a cheap fountain pen from the local art store and then quickly moved on to the Lamy Safari, which then led to me buying a Pilot Vanishing Point. Fast forward to today and I now own around 19 fountain pens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I’ve started my fountain pen collection / hobby, I’ve wanted to write a review / blog post about pens. I’m not sure why it has taken me so long to write a post about pens. I think part of the problem is that there are already so many great pen bloggers already out there who have better collections and know much more about pens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK. Enough excuses / prologue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now to the main point of this post:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-architect-nib">The Architect Nib&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’ve mainly used Japanese fine fountain pen nibs and decided it was time to try a different kind of nib. I’ve heard a lot about the architect grind nib and thought it would be fun to try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found a great deal on Amazon for a Pilot Vanishing Point with a broad nib. I thought the Vanishing Point would work best since I could just replace the nib unit if I didn’t like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is an architect nib? Basically it is a nib that has thin vertical strokes and thick horizontal strokes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reading the review on &lt;a href="https://clickypost.com" target="_blank">clickypost.com&lt;/a> about the architect nib work by Daniel Smith, I decided to send my pen to &lt;a href="https://nibsmith.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Smith&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am really enjoying how the architect nib writes! It’s bolder than I’m used to, but I think the line variation adds a lot of character to my writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole process was pretty easy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Bought the pen and made sure it worked&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Emailed Daniel Smith about the architect nib work I wanted&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Shipped Daniel Smith my pen&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>He emailed scans of writing samples so I could see progress of the work&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>He made a few adjustments since I thought the first writing sample was too bold for me&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>He then suggested I try the pen&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Again, the pen, at first, seemed too bold for me, but the more I use the pen, the more fun it is to write with. Daniel Smith was very kind and patient with all my emails where I was going back and forth on how wide the nib should be. The quality of his work is also great. The nib is very smooth, which is a bit shocking for this kind of custom nib grind. I would definitely recommend Daniel Smith and would send more pens to him for custom grinds / tuning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of the architect nib was $55, plus shipping. I know that could seem like a lot for a pen, but I’ve enjoyed the pen so far. There are more expensive hobbies. That’s what I tell myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note: Below are some writing samples (including this blog post as it originally existed: a hand written blog post). Part of me doesn’t want to share the blog post that I wrote by hand since it’s not my neatest handwriting example, but I figured this would be a good way for people to see what the architect nib looks like in practice.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
