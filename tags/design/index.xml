&lt;a href=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2024/10/11/rollei-35-3d-printed-cold-shoe-project/rollei-35-01.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;post&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2024/10/11/rollei-35-3d-printed-cold-shoe-project/rollei-35-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rollei 35 with 3D-printed cold shoe&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Rollei 35 with 3D-printed cold shoe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;has-drop-cap&#34;&gt;I was tired of attaching my small light meter to the bottom of my Rollei 35 as the hot shoe is on the bottom of the camera. This means that you cannot lay the camera down on a table with the bottom of the camera on the table surface. It also means that you need to hold the camera upside down to meter and then flip the camera back upright to take the photograph. These are small details, but small details matter. I love how small the Rollei 35 camera is, but wanted to figure out how to mount my light meter on the top of the camera. I decided the easiest solution was to design and 3d print a cold shoe that I could tape to the top of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;searching-for-existing-designs&#34;&gt;Searching for existing designs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first started by searching the internet to see if someone had already solved this problem. It seems that a few people have also 3d-printed a cold shoe for the Rollei 35, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any source files and I didn&amp;rsquo;t like solutions I was seeing online for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then decided to search for just a regular cold shoe 3d model that I could modify to fit the Rollei 35. In my search on Printables, I found a cold shoe design that was licensed under a Creative Commons license that allowed for modifications as long as I share my design under the same Creative Commons license. The file I found is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.printables.com/model/250786-cold-shoe-for-storage-cheese-plate/files&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cold Shoe (for Storage Cheese Plate)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;rollei-35-02.png&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;post&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2024/10/11/rollei-35-3d-printed-cold-shoe-project/rollei-35-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;FreeCAD showing the found Printables cold shoe STL file&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Cold shoe STL file that I found on Printables website&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modifying-the-source-file&#34;&gt;Modifying the source file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I have modified a 3D model (architecture school was a long time ago). I downloaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecad.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FreeCAD&lt;/a&gt; and started figuring out how to modify the part I found to fit and work on the Rollei 35. After a lot of measurements, Google searches, and YouTube videos, I was able to create a new part that will fit on top of the Rollei 35 camera. The design had to place the light meter in the location I wanted while allowing room for the film advance lever and the lens retract button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;rollei-35-03.png&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;post&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2024/10/11/rollei-35-3d-printed-cold-shoe-project/rollei-35-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;FreeCAD showing the found Printables cold shoe STL file&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;My cold shoe design, made specifically for the Rollei 35&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;printing-my-new-design&#34;&gt;Printing my new design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then went to my local university and printed my new design in white PLA plastic. My light meter fit in the first 3D print, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t make any changes or updates to the design file. I then purchased 3M VHB double-sided tape so I could attach the cold shoe to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2024/10/11/rollei-35-3d-printed-cold-shoe-project/rollei-35-04.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;post&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2024/10/11/rollei-35-3d-printed-cold-shoe-project/rollei-35-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Printing the cold shoe design&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Printing my design. The print took around 40 minutes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-final-design&#34;&gt;The final design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added 3M VHB double-sided tape to the cold shoe so I could easily and securely attach it to the top of the Rollei 35. I also added painter&amp;rsquo;s tape to the bottom of the cold shoe slot, folding the tape on itself at the edge to provide some friction for the light meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;has-drop-cap&#34;&gt;I rediscovered typewriters at the end of 2021 and have not looked back. It has been great to write more and to spend less time on a computer or phone. Below are some thoughts about my recent typewriter journey that I typed on my Olympia B12 typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that a scan of a typed page might be hard to read on smaller devices or if you are using a screen reader.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-history-of-my-history-with-typewriters&#34;&gt;A brief history of my history with typewriters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had limited experience with typewriters before the end of 2021. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the make or model of the typewriter I had when I was a kid. I was gifted a broken IBM Selectric around 2010-12 (I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact date), but was unable to fix it at the time and got rid of it. I wish I would have kept it as I might be able to have it fixed now. Several years ago I bought a cheap Smith Corona SL460 electric typewriter and have used it a few times over the years, but typewriters never really became a part of my routine. Things changed at the end of 2021 when I watched a documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;watching-a-documentary-leads-to-more-research-and-purchases&#34;&gt;Watching a documentary leads to more research and purchases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 22 December I decided to watch the documentary &lt;em&gt;California Typewriter&lt;/em&gt; (2016). I was excited to learn more about typewriter history and see how people are using typewriters today. Instead of being inspired to use the electronic typewriter that I already owned, I was inspired to try and find a mechanical typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after watching the documentary I called my local typewriter shop to see what portable mechanical typewriters they had for sale. I went to the shop and spent over an hour talking with the repairman and tried the two machines that he had for sale. I decided to purchase the Olympia B12 because it was a bit newer (1970s) and hoped it would be in better shape than the 1940s Royal Arrow that he had in the shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-do-without-my-new-typewriter&#34;&gt;What to do without my new typewriter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after getting my new-to-me typewriter we were traveling for Christmas vacation. I briefly debated bringing my new-to-me typewriter with me, but graciously decided to spare my family the clicking and clacking of the typewriter keys as I learned how to type on a mechanical typewriter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing my typewriter I remembered that Tom Hanks had written a book called &lt;em&gt;Uncommon Type&lt;/em&gt;, which is a collection of short stories that all have one thing in common: there is a typewriter in each story, even if it only plays a small role. I checked my library&amp;rsquo;s eBook catalog and they had a copy so I downloaded it and started to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;just-a-quick-recap-of-my-typewriter-timeline&#34;&gt;Just a quick recap of my typewriter timeline:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 1: watch a typewriter documentary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 2: buy another typewriter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day 3: start reading typewriter fiction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I had some experience with typewriters, this new or renewed interest was strong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new year I borrowed the book &lt;em&gt;Typewriter Revolution: A Typist&amp;rsquo;s Companion for the 21st Century&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Polt from the library. I found the book to be a great balance of history, buying recommendations, guidance on how to maintain and repair typewriters, and inspiration on how to use a typewriter today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-beginning-of-a-typewriter-collection&#34;&gt;The beginning of a typewriter collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using the Olympia B12 for a while, I decided that I would like to add an Olivetti Lettera 32 to what was becoming a small collection. The Olympia B12 has been a fine typewriter to use, but there are some aspects that are not the best (the carriage return seems a bit &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo; and the keys have a distant, soft feel). I eventually found and purchased an Olivetti Lettera 32, but the machine was never quite right. I tried to make some adjustments myself and a very kind person also tried to fix it, but it sadly had too many issues, especially after shipping which seemed to cause more issues. I will have to try and find another Lettera 32 or some other kind of machine. The search continues!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-why-type-on-a-typewriter&#34;&gt;But, why type on a typewriter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOCUS. It is so freeing to type on this machine and not be distracted with notifications, spelling corrections, and the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy and find helpful the lack of judgement from myself and the computer when I type on a typewriter. On a computer I have the desire to edit too early in the process of writing. The computer also takes you out of the creative flow with grammer and spelling suggestions and corrections. There is a time to edit, but that should not be too early in the writing process. Writing without judgement allows you to try things and see what does and doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not alone in these feelings about using a typewriter and you will find these discussed and more in the documentary &lt;em&gt;California Typewriter&lt;/em&gt; that I mentioned earlier. If you have any interest in typewriters, I recommend you watch it. I watched it on Kanopy, a streaming video platform for public libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practice&#34;&gt;Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my renewed interest in typewriters, I want to get better at typing on a typewriter (and writing in general). The only way to get better at something is practice. I am currently doing a 100-day challenge where I write at least 15 minutes per day. There are days where I do not make the time to write and when that happens, I just push my deadline back by a day. I do this because I want to write for all 100 days, it will just take me a bit longer than 100 days to finish the 100-day challenge. I can see an improvement in my typing technique over the almost 60 days that I have typed so far. I also miss typing on the days that I skip. I am going to take that as a positive sign that a typing habit is forming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you type on a typewriter? What do you like most about typing? Do you have a favorite typewriter (if so, what and why)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olympia B12, pica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Braun, Apple, Lamy</title>

	  &lt;p class=&#34;has-drop-cap&#34;&gt;The other day at work I was using my Apple AirPods and noticed that they looked nice beside my Lamy Safari fountain pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2017/04/19/braun-apple-lamy/braun-apple-lamy-1.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;post&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2017/04/19/braun-apple-lamy/braun-apple-lamy-1.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Apple AirPods and Lamy Safari fountain pen on a desk&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that my Lamy Safari and Apple AirPods are the same color helps the two products look good together, but there are a few other similarities that I noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glossy finish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark rounded rectangles (ink window versus speaker design)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metal accents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2017/04/19/braun-apple-lamy/braun-apple-lamy-2.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;post&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2017/04/19/braun-apple-lamy/braun-apple-lamy-2.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Open Apple AirPods case and Lamy Safari fountain pen on a desk&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I thought about the Apple AirPods and Lamy Safari fountain pen, it reminded me of Braun design (back when Braun design was interesting). This isn’t too shocking as a lot of Apple’s designs have to be inspired by Braun (if they aren’t, I’d be shocked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flipped through my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/BRAUN-Fifty-Years-Design-Innovation-Polster/dp/393668135X&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Braun: Fifty Years of Design and Innovation&lt;/a&gt; book and found a photo of electric shavers from the 1960s. I know it isn’t an exact match, but I feel there are some similarities between the Apple AirPods case and the Braun electric shavers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2017/04/19/braun-apple-lamy/braun-apple-lamy-3.jpg&#34; data-lightbox=&#34;post&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://andsplat.com/2017/04/19/braun-apple-lamy/braun-apple-lamy-3.jpg&#34;  alt=&#34;Braun book showing various Braun electric shavers&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
