            <p class="has-drop-cap">I still have a blog. It‚Äôs been way too long since I last posted. I‚Äôve wanted to post, but have just not made the time.</p>
<p><a href="architect-nib_1.jpg" data-lightbox="post"><img src="architect-nib_1.jpg"  alt="Close up image of the Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen with a writing sample"></a></p>
<p>Why blog? Will people even read my blog? Does it matter if people read my blog? I mainly blog as an excuse to design and build my own website. I also like sharing with friends the things I‚Äôm working on or random things I‚Äôve observed (random typos in the world, for example).</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I‚Äôve started to really like fountain pans. I started with a cheap fountain pen from the local art store and then quickly moved on to the Lamy Safari, which then led to me buying a Pilot Vanishing Point. Fast forward to today and I now own around 19 fountain pens.</p>
<p>As I‚Äôve started my fountain pen collection / hobby, I‚Äôve wanted to write a review / blog post about pens. I‚Äôm not sure why it has taken me so long to write a post about pens. I think part of the problem is that there are already so many great pen bloggers already out there who have better collections and know much more about pens.</p>
<p>OK. Enough excuses / prologue.</p>
<p>Now to the main point of this post:</p>
<h2 id="the-architect-nib">The Architect Nib</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve mainly used Japanese fine fountain pen nibs and decided it was time to try a different kind of nib. I‚Äôve heard a lot about the architect grind nib and thought it would be fun to try.</p>
<p>I found a great deal on Amazon for a Pilot Vanishing Point with a broad nib. I thought the Vanishing Point would work best since I could just replace the nib unit if I didn‚Äôt like it.</p>
<p>What is an architect nib? Basically it is a nib that has thin vertical strokes and thick horizontal strokes.</p>
<p>After reading the review on <a href="https://clickypost.com" target="_blank">clickypost.com</a> about the architect nib work by Daniel Smith, I decided to send my pen to <a href="https://nibsmith.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Smith</a>.</p>
<p>I am really enjoying how the architect nib writes! It‚Äôs bolder than I‚Äôm used to, but I think the line variation adds a lot of character to my writing.</p>
<p>The whole process was pretty easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bought the pen and made sure it worked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emailed Daniel Smith about the architect nib work I wanted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shipped Daniel Smith my pen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He emailed scans of writing samples so I could see progress of the work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He made a few adjustments since I thought the first writing sample was too bold for me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He then suggested I try the pen</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the pen, at first, seemed too bold for me, but the more I use the pen, the more fun it is to write with. Daniel Smith was very kind and patient with all my emails where I was going back and forth on how wide the nib should be. The quality of his work is also great. The nib is very smooth, which is a bit shocking for this kind of custom nib grind. I would definitely recommend Daniel Smith and would send more pens to him for custom grinds / tuning.</p>
<p>The cost of the architect nib was $55, plus shipping. I know that could seem like a lot for a pen, but I‚Äôve enjoyed the pen so far. There are more expensive hobbies. That‚Äôs what I tell myself.</p>
<p><em>Note: Below are some writing samples (including this blog post as it originally existed: a hand written blog post). Part of me doesn‚Äôt want to share the blog post that I wrote by hand since it‚Äôs not my neatest handwriting example, but I figured this would be a good way for people to see what the architect nib looks like in practice.</em></p>
